# Example: Plotting LRO Results for AlCoCrFeNi

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook script that demonstrates how to **load and plot the simulation results** generated by `MC_BCC_CCA.py`.

---

## What this Example Shows

- Reads the output text files (`LRO.txt`, `Al.txt`, `Co.txt`, `Cr.txt`, `Fe.txt`, `Ni.txt`) from a simulation run.  
- Plots the long-range order (LRO) parameter vs. temperature for each element.  
- Produces a clear visualization of how ordering evolves as the system is cooled.

---

## Simulation Parameters for this Example

The plotted data corresponds to the alloy **AlCoCrFeNi**, using:

- **Lattice size:** 12 × 12 × 24 (z dimension doubled by construction)  
- **Steps per temperature:** 1,000 attempted swaps  
- **Temperature schedule:** 1800 K → 0 K (step of 1 K)  

Output files were saved to the folder:  
`Al0.20Co0.20Cr0.20Fe0.20Ni0.20/`

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have run the main simulation (`MC_BCC_CCA.py`) to generate output files.  
2. Place the notebook in this `Example` folder.  
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.  

This will produce a plot of element-resolved LRO vs. temperature for Al, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni.
